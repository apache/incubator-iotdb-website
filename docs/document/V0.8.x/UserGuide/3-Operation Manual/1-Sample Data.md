# Sample Data

To make this manual more practical, we will use a specific scenario example to illustrate how to operate IoTDB databases at all stages of use. See [this page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-iotdb/blob/master/docs/Documentation/OtherMaterial-Sample%20Data.txt) for a look. For your convenience, we also provide you with a sample data file in real scenario to import into the IoTDB system for trial and operation.
