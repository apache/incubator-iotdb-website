# Verifying Hashes and Signatures

Along with our releases, we also provide sha512 hashes in *.sha512 files and cryptographic signatures in *.asc files. The Apache Software Foundation has an extensive tutorial to [verify hashes and signatures ](http://www.apache.org/info/verification.html)which you can follow by using any of these release-signing [KEYS ](https://downloads.apache.org/incubator/iotdb/KEYS).
