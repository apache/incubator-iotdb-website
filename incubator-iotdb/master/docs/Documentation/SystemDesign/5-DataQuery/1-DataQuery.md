# Data query

There are several types of data queries

* Raw data query
* Aggregate query
* Downsampling query
* Single point supplementary null query
* Latest data query

In order to achieve the above kinds of queries, a basic query component for a single time series is designed in the IoTDB query engine, and on this basis, various query functions are implemented.
